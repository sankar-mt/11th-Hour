The project is a fully functional mobile application that enables the user
to access important services at times of emergencies. This application
also provides the features to send panic messages or distress signals
to the users in the proximity and alerts them. Most of the people who
are caught up in a panic or emergencies lose their logical ability to think
and respond effectively. In such events, users can use this application
to access important information required to recover back. The app also
provides users with a map that locates the nearest service.
